# Platform documentation

Both the OpenShift and the Kubernetes projects maintain extensive user
documentation. When looking at documentation, you should keep in mind that the
documentation is versioned for each version of the platform. You should look at
documentation for the platform with which you are currently working with. You
can find out the relevant version information with the `oc version` command line
command while logged in to the OpenShift environment.
