    If you have access to \env{SYSTEM_NAME} via multiple CSC computing
    projects, you may need to explicitly specify which one to use when

Welcome to the \env{SYSTEM_NAME} container cloud! If you are not yet
familiar with container technology or container orchestration systems such as
Kubernetes or OpenShift, you could start by reading a generic introduction to
the topic:

  * [Background on container orchestration](/introduction/background/)

If you are already familiar with container technology and Kubernetes/OpenShift,
you could move directly to the instructions for getting access to \env{SYSTEM_NAME}:

  * [Getting access](/introduction/access/)

If you already have access to \env{SYSTEM_NAME}, then you can skip ahead to usage
documentation and the links to external documentation:

  * [Usage](/usage/getting_started/)
  * [External documentation](/ext_docs/)
