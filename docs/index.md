Welcome to the ${SYSTEM_NAME} container cloud! If you are not yet
familiar with container technology or container orchestration systems such as
Kubernetes or OpenShift, you could start by reading a generic introduction to
the topic:

  * [Background on container orchestration](introduction/background)

If you are already familiar with container technology and Kubernetes/OpenShift,
you could move directly to the instructions for getting access to ${SYSTEM_NAME}:

  * [Getting access](introduction/access)

If you already have access to ${SYSTEM_NAME}, then you can skip ahead to usage
documentation and the links to external documentation:

  * [Usage](usage/getting_started)
  * [External documentation](ext_docs)
