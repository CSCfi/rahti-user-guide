## Rahti user guide

Welcome to the Rahti user guide! If you are not yet familiar with container
technology or container orchestration systems such as Kubernetes or OpenShift,
you could start by reading a generic introduction to the topic:

  * [Background on container orchestration](introduction/background)

If you are already familiar with container technology and Kubernetes/OpenShift,
you could move directly to the instructions for getting access to Rahti:

  * [Getting access](introduction/access)

If you already have access to Rahti, then you can skip ahead to usage
documentation and the links to external documentation:

  * [Usage](usage/getting_started)
  * [External documentation](ext_docs)
