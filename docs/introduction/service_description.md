# Scope and description of the service

\env{SYSTEM_NAME} is a cloud computing service that allows Users to host
applications and make them accessible over the web. The \env{SYSTEM_NAME}
service is based on OKD, which is a distribution of Kubernetes. The
\env{SYSTEM_NAME} service provides, but is not necessarily limited to, these
features:

* Hosting of User Applications comprised of container instances and groups of
  container instances
* Storage services
* Virtual networks for connecting container instances
* Load balancing of traffic to User Applications
* An application catalog with templates for ready-to-use common applications
* Features for replication, rolling updates, auto-recovery and auto-scaling of User Applications
* Basic default domain name and TLS for hosted User Applications (under rahtiapp.fi)

Users can manage their resources using a web interface accessible through a web
browser and through a set of APIs which allow programmatic management of
resources. In order to access and use the service the User must have a CSC user
account.

The User's applications are isolated from other Usersâ€™ applications from a
network, storage and computational view.
