# User policy and terms of use for the Rahti container cloud service

This section describes additional terms and examples specific to the *Rahti
container cloud service* (hereafter referred to as "*Rahti*"). Please also read the
[General Terms of Use for CSC's Services for Research and Education
("TOU")](https://research.csc.fi/general-terms-of-use). By using *Rahti* you are
agreeing to both.

## Terminology

* *Rahti container cloud service ("Rahti")*: a cloud platform that can be used
  by *Users* to run their own *User Applications*.
* *Rahti User ("User")*: a user of *Rahti*.
* *User Application*: an application running in *Rahti* managed by one or more
  *Users*. Some of these applications can be used to provide a service for one
  or more *End Users*.
* *End User*: a user of a *User Application* that is hosted in *Rahti*. An *End
  User* may also be a *Rahti User*.
* *User Content ("Content")*: any data uploaded to *Rahti* or created using
  *Rahti* either by *Users* or *End Users*. This includes but is not limited to
  container images, snapshots, data on persistent volumes and data on any
  filesystem used by a *User Application*.

## Providing services to End Users from Rahti

* *Users* are reminded that *Rahti* must only be used for the purpose agreed on
  in their User/Resource application or other agreement concerning the use of
  *Rahti*.
* *Rahti* can only be used to provide *User Applications* for academic research
  and higher education by Finnish universities, polytechnics and state research
  institutes, unless agreed otherwise.

## Access for 3rd party technical assistance and support

*Rahti Users* may request additional CSC user accounts for technical specialists
to operate, manage or configure their resources if it assists with the agreed
purpose of the project.

## Security responsibilities

* *User Applications* launched by *Users* in *Rahti* can be directly connected
  to the Internet. The *User* is responsible for the security of their *User
  Applications*.
* *Users* are responsible for managing their access control lists, user accounts
  and all other access control methods.
* *Users* are responsible for maintaining application security within the *User
  Applications* they host in *Rahti*. We recommend applying all applicable
  security updates automatically or otherwise at regular and well managed
  intervals.

## Content and data management responsibilities

* Most *Content* is not backed up and it is the *Users'* responsibility to
  manage their own *Content*.
* The places where *Users* or *End Users* can store *Content* including persistent
  volumes, container file systems and local storage are not backed up. It is the
  *Users'* responsibility to make backups of *Content* as needed.
* The configuration of the *Rahti* service itself and metadata on resources
  created in *Rahti* are backed up in such a way that we can restore *Rahti* in
  case of failures.

## Access to User Content

The General Terms of Use for CSC's Services for Science state that CSC can
access *User Content*.

For *Rahti* this means that:

* CSC has the right to scan or monitor *User Content* for security
  vulnerabilities, violations of our terms of use, or to perform anonymised
  analysis of workloads, for example by:
  * Scanning of container images for prohibited applications.
  * Scanning the *User Applications* running within *Rahti*.
* CSC has the right to do passive network monitoring for intrusion detection (IDS)
  purposes. This monitoring can occur without suspicion of intrusion.
* CSC has the right to disable any or all of a *User's* *User Applications*
  running in *Rahti* or network connections to or from *Rahti* if we suspect an
  ongoing security violation or a violation of our Terms of Use.

## User risks

* *Users* are reminded to consider the design and reliability of *Rahti* and
  plan accordingly.
* As with any cloud service, *User Applications* in *Rahti* and their data can
  be lost or corrupted due to hardware failure, system error, administrator
  error or user errors.
